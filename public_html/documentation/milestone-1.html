<h2>PERSONA</h2>
<p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    Meet Janeya Johnson, she is a 38 year old woman who is a mother to three children. Janeya works in the healthcare industry and has a very busy schedule. She uses her Iphone for everything. Although she has a computer at home it is slightly outdated and she rarely uses it. She loves Netflix prefers to watch it on her smart TV at home when she is done with her day and trying to relax in the evening. She is excellent at navigating her favorite social media platforms, Instagram, Facebook and sometimes TikTok but is a little intimidated by the big world wide web, so the websites she visits must be easy to use, helpful and keep her attention with the design and content.
