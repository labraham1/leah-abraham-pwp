    <p>Creating an official website for my company; Leah Abraham Alignment Advocacy LLC.</p>

<p>
    <h2>PURPOSE</h2>
</p>
<P>
    The purpose of creating this website is to provide a safe, supportive space for current clients, potential clients and those on their healing journey. Here they can connect with and engage with community and access the 5Step Healing Process as an online course. This website will also provide information about me and the work that I do. It will also serve as the primary way to contact me for collaborations, 1:1 work or to hire me for speaking engagements. (MISSION STATEMENT) To empower individuals to take healing into their own hands, reminding those I work with that they are their own greatest healer. To increase awareness and education around the connection between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and the struggles (mental,physical, psychological, physiological and spiritual) that we face now as adults.
</P>
<p>
    <h2>AUDIENCE</h2>
<p>
    This website is for those who are already on their healing journey and those who are looking to begin healing. The audience is anyone who is in pain (mental or physical) that has not found or connected to a diagnosis that feels right to them or is helping them heal. The audience is made up of individuals who have trauma in childhood, specifically sexual abuse trauma and who are open to different modalities of healing. The audience are individuals who have created enough safety in their lives to begin/continue healing and who are willing to look at their current and past situations with eyes of clarity, letting go of the denial they may have carried. The audience is made up of individuals who may have addictions but are wanting to shift the relationship they have with those patterns. The majority of the audience will be filtered in through Instagram, Facebook or X.
</p>
<h2>GOAL</h2>
<p>
    The goal for creating this website is to increase the availability of my services to a wider audience. I also want to provide a safe space for the community I have built/am building to connect, engage and stay involved with new offerings. This website will also provide the purchase of my signature program, the 5Step Healing Process, in the form of an online course. This will generate passive income. Ultimate goal... GROW MY BUSINESS, INCREASE IMPACT AND GENERATE GREATER REVENUE.

<h2>PERSONA</h2>
<p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    Meet Janeya Johnson... She is 38, mother to three children and enjoys dancing. Janeya works in the healthcare industry and has a very busy schedule. She uses her Iphone for everything! Although she has a computer at home, it is slightly outdated and she rarely uses it. She loves Netflix and prefers to watch it on her smart TV at home when she is done with her day and trying to relax in the evening. She is excellent at navigating her favorite social media platforms, Instagram, Facebook and sometimes TikTok but is a little intimidated by the big world wide web, so the websites she visits must be easy to use, helpful and keep her attention with their design and content.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Situation/Why Visit My Website</h3>
    Janeya has recently been experiencing pain that the doctors are identifying as fibromyalgia, she spends more days than not in a state of depression and her anxiety has increased. As a result of this decline in health/mental health Janeya has been doing her own research during her lunch breaks at work, she has come across a few holistic doctors who she now follows on social media. She is learning more about the connection between her Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and her health/mental health. As a result of this research and new connections, her algorithm is changing. She is getting a lot more content on childhood trauma and somatic healing. She is scrolling through Instagram and comes across a live, the woman is talking about a 5Step Healling Process that helps address and begin healing childhood trauma. Because nothing the doctors are doing is helping and all the medications she has tried have awful side effects (and are not entirely helpful) she decides to check this out. She clicks on the Instagram profile, @leahabraham1111 and starts reading the posts and watching the videos. Janeya really connects with the style of communication and perspective around healing the body that Leah is talking about. By the time Janeya's lunch break is over she has decided she wants to check out the 5Step Healing Process. So she makes note of the website, where she can access the 5Step Healing Process online course and plans to check it out in the evening after the kids have all gone to bed. That night she VISITS THE WEBSITE... leahabraham.com
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Frustrations</h3>
    By this point in Janeya's health journey, she is really frustrated that the doctors are not able to "fix" her issues. She knows there must be more to this and so she starts doing her own research and although she is open to exploring alternative healing options, many of the concepts she has come across are just as far fetched as the magic pills shes been prescribed. She has had her fill of toxic positivity and just doesnt align with ancestral healing or energy healing, she is starting to get super frustrated that her only option is to keep trying the different drugs that her doctor keeps pushing on her. She really wants guidance and to feel empowered in her ability to heal. She is reluctant to try this 5Step Healing Process but so far, what she has hears seems interesting and she is willing to explore it further... she is tired of being sick and tired, she wants to feel like herself again and to enjoy being in her body and creating memories with her children, she wants to live life, pain free and in joy!
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Goals For Using My Site</h3>
Janeya is hopeful that she will find what she is looking for on Leah's website. She really hopes that she will find an alternative to her current health plan. As she types in the website she thinks about her expectations. She really wants the website to match the be an extension of the Instagram page she visited earlier, she hopes the tone and energy of the website will match that of the Instagram page. She hopes the 5Step Healing Process with be easy to find, purchase and access. And she is looking forward to reading more about what others are saying about the 5Step Healing Process. She is HOPEFUL that visiting Leah's website will open new doors and provide options that are more aligned with the way she wants to live her life and heal her body. Janeya's ultimate goal is TO HEAL HER BODY and IMPROVE HER MENTAL HEALTH.
</p>
<P>
    <H3>Additional Information To Reach Goal</H3>
    It is important to note that visiting the website will allow for Janeya to take healing into her own hands, by scheduling the time she spends on the site and on the 5Step Healing Process around her schedule and what works for her. Sometimes she has to take off work to get to her appointments and sometimes she misses time with her children because of the severity of her pain, depression and anxiety. Visiting this site is something she can do WITH her children, and when it is convenient for her. Since the 5Step Healing Process is a course she can do online (on the website) it is available anytime. Because the website also offers a way for Leah's community to connect, engage and support each other; this will be an additional benefit to Janeya. She can connect with others who have been in her situation and who understand where she is coming from. She will be able to ask her peers questions about the 5Steps and talk about what comes up for her as she goes through the process.
